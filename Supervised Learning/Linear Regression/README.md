# Linear Regressiom #

## Introduction ##

Linear regression is used to model the relationship between two variables and estimate the value of a response by using a line-of-best-fit. This calculator is built for simple linear regression, where only one predictor variable (X) and one response (Y) are used. Using our calculator is as simple as copying and pasting the corresponding X and Y values into the table (don't forget to add labels for the variable names). Below the calculator we include resources for learning more about the assumptions and interpretation of linear regression.

## Steps ##
1. State the hypothesis. 
2. State the null hypothesis 
3. Gather the data. 
4. Compute the regression equation 
5. Examine tests of statistical significant and measures of association 
6. Relate statistical findings to the hypothesis. Accept or reject the null hypothesis. 
7. Reject, accept or revise the original hypothesis. Make suggestions for research design and management aspects of the problem.

## Data ##

we are using the linear regression method to predict the future rainfall for Austion by using HIstorical AUstin weather Data.
This Data is from Kaggle.This dataset was obtained from WeatherUnderground.com, at the Austin KATT station. And we can use this dataset to predict future weather.
## Libraries ##
1. Matplotlib
2. Pandas
3. Numpy
