# Support Vector Machine #

##  Introduction ##

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a very powerful and versatile Machine Learning model, capable of performing linear or nonlinear classification, regression, and even outlier detection. It is one of the most popular models in Machine Learning, and any‐ one interested in Machine Learning should have it in their toolbox. SVMs are partic‐ ularly well suited for classification of complex but small- or medium-sized datasets.


## Types of Svm ##

1. Simple SVM: Typically used for linear regression and classification problems.
2. Kernel SVM: Has more flexibility for non-linear data because you can add more features to fit a hyperplane instead of a two-dimensional space.

## what we will do ##

I will use the SVM algorithm to predict the rainfall in Austin.
## Data ##

This data is from kaggle. This data contains histroical weather of Austin. It contrains parameters like,Average Temperature, Highest Tempertaure, something like this.

## Libraries ##
not limited to
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
