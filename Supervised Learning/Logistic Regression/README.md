## Logistic Regression ##

## 1. Introduction ##

Logistic regression is a process of modeling the probability of a discrete outcome given an input variable. The most common logistic regression models a binary outcome; something that can take two values such as true/false, yes/no, and so on.

Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary).  Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.  Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.

Sometimes logistic regressions are difficult to interpret; the Intellectus Statistics tool easily allows you to conduct the analysis, then in plain English 
interprets the output.

## Task ##
we are using the IRIS data to do teh logistic regression to classify the species.
##  Data ##
This is perhaps the best known database. The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. It can be used as predicting class of iris plant.
## Libraries ##
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
