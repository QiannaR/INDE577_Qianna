# Single Layer Perceptron #

## 1. Introduction ##
The perceptron is a single processing unit of any neural network. Frank Rosenblatt first proposed in 1958 is a simple neuron which is used to classify its input into one or two categories. Perceptron is a linear classifier, and is used in supervised learning. It helps to organize the given input data.

A perceptron is a neural network unit that does a precise computation to detect features in the input data. Perceptron is mainly used to classify the data into two parts. Therefore, it is also known as Linear Binary Classifier.

## Tasks ##
In this project, I will build a perceptron model from scratch and implement the perceptron learning algorithm f

I will use the following libraries:

1. [matplotlib] (https://matplotlib.org/)
2. [pandas] (https://pandas.pydata.org/)
3. [numpy] (https://numpy.org/)
4. [seaborn] (https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
5. [scikit-learn] (https://scikit-learn.org/) ...
