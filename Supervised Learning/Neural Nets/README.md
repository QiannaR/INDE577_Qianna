# Neural Nets #

## Introduction ##

Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling or clustering raw input. The patterns they recognize are numerical, contained in vectors, into which all real-world data, be it images, sound, text or time series, must be translated.

## Steps ##

1. Create an approximation model.
2. Configure data set.
3. Set network architecture.
4. Train neural network.
5. Improve generalization performance.
6. Test results.
7. Deploy model.
